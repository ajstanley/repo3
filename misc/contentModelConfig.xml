Example of content model configuration as explained in the document sent earlier.
The attributes RELS-EXT and html-div refer to a dynamic dissemination through the Fedora Content Model Architecture; batchModify contains a space-separated list of them.
A missing attribute on a model element means no action.
We would like to see (if feasible) a consistent naming convention for content models, e.g. model:Image (capitalized as they are a sort of classes) instead of the names in existing solution packs.
